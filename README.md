An ETL pipeline for transforming OMOP datasets into the MEDS format using the MEDS-Transforms library.
Thanks to the developers of the first OMOP MEDS ETL, from which we took inspiration,
which can be found here: https://github.com/Medical-Event-Data-Standard/meds_etl.
We currently support OMOP 5.3 and 5.4 datasets.

```bash
pip install OMOP_MEDS
OMOP_MEDS root_output_dir=$ROOT_OUTPUT_DIR
```

To try with the MIMIC-IV OMOP demo dataset, you can run:

```bash
OMOP_MEDS root_output_dir=/path/to/your/output do_download=True ++do_demo=True
```

Example config for an OMOP dataset:

```yaml
dataset_name: MIMIC_IV_OMOP
raw_dataset_version: 1.0
omop_version: 5.3

urls:
  dataset:
    - https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo-omop/0.9/
    - url: EXAMPLE_CONTROLLED_URL
      username: ${oc.env:DATASET_DOWNLOAD_USERNAME}
      password: ${oc.env:DATASET_DOWNLOAD_PASSWORD}
  demo:
    - https://physionet.org/content/mimic-iv-demo-omop/0.9/
  common:
    - EXAMPLE_SHARED_URL # Often used for shared metadata files
```

## Pre-MEDS settings

The following settings can be used to configure the pre-MEDS steps.

```bash
root_output_dir=path/to/your/output
raw_input_dir=/path/to/your/raw/input
do_download=False # Set to True to download the dataset
++do_overwrite=True # Set to True to overwrite existing files
++do_demo=True # Set to True to process demo dataset
++limit_subjects=50 # Limit the number of subjects to process
```

## MEDS-transforms settings

If you want to convert a large dataset, you can use parallelization with MEDS-transforms
(the MEDS-transformation step that takes the longest).

Using local parallelization with the `hydra-joblib-launcher` package, you can set the number of workers:

```
pip install hydra-joblib-launcher --upgrade
```

Then, you can set the number of workers as environment variable:

```bash
export N_WORKERS=16
```

Moreover, you can set the number of subjects per shard to balance the parallelization overhead based on how many subjects you have in your dataset:

```bash
export N_SUBJECTS_PER_SHARD=1000
```
